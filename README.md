## Introduction

Welcome to **StackWrapper**! This component simplifies the process of arranging elements in a flexible layout. It adapts to different screen sizes, making it perfect for iOS development. With StackWrapper, you can easily manage your UI elements, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.

## Features

- **Dynamic Layout**: Automatically adjusts height and width based on the elements and screen size.
- **Customizable Properties**: Tailor your design with various layout options.
- **SwiftUI Compatibility**: Built with Swift and SwiftUI for seamless integration.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead for fast performance.
- **Flexible Stacking**: Use horizontal or vertical stacking as needed.

## Installation

To install StackWrapper, you can use Swift Package Manager (SPM). Follow these steps:

1. Open your Xcode project.
2. Go to `File` > `Swift Packages` > `Add Package Dependency`.
3. Enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/killer5962/StackWrapper`.
4. Choose the version you want to use.

## Usage

Using StackWrapper is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import StackWrapper

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        StackWrapper {
            Text("Hello, World!")
            Image(systemName: "star")
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

This code creates a basic layout with a text label and an image. StackWrapper takes care of arranging these elements for you.

## Customization

StackWrapper offers several properties for customization:

- **Spacing**: Control the space between elements.
- **Alignment**: Align elements to the start, center, or end.
- **Padding**: Add padding around the stack.

Hereâ€™s how to customize the spacing and alignment:

```swift
StackWrapper(spacing: 10, alignment: .center) {
    Text("Welcome")
    Image(systemName: "heart")
}
```

## Examples

### Vertical Stack

```swift
StackWrapper(axis: .vertical) {
    Text("Item 1")
    Text("Item 2")
    Text("Item 3")
}
```

### Horizontal Stack

```swift
StackWrapper(axis: .horizontal) {
    Text("Left")
    Spacer()
    Text("Right")
}
```

### Custom Spacing and Alignment

```swift
StackWrapper(spacing: 20, alignment: .leading) {
    Text("First")
    Text("Second")
}
```
